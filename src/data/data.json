I worked 2 - 3 jobs since I know myself, no Saturdays or Sundays free. I feel your pain better than anyone as I fight pain every single day, and I win every single time.In the last 7 years I dedicated my entire life to put a STOP to high paid jobs being inaccessible for people without company experience, without a portfolio or how to get a job against hundreds of aplicants for the same job.My moto is to Deliver on Promise and bring the WoW factor with every client you win! Shall we start to copy/paste more than three (3) decades of experience into your valuable skills?",

I started as a Project Manager Intern at WoW DoP with Zero knowledge and focused on discovering how project needs come to life from client to developer I soon fell in love with converting designs and requirements into React Components so I can express myself more dynamically with my web solutions. I started looking for an opportunity on the 10th of January, and six weeks later I was presented with my first trial. I have three months to convert everything I do now know into my greatest assets!",
